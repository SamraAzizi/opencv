# Text Extraction (OCR) with OpenCV and Tesseract

This project demonstrates how to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using OpenCV and Tesseract. The code loads an image, processes it with Tesseract to extract text, and then highlights the detected text on the image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pillow (PIL)
- Tesseract-OCR
- pytesseract

## Installation

### Python Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install opencv-python pillow pytesseract
```


## Tesseract-OCR

You also need to have Tesseract-OCR installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Tesseract GitHub repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).

Ensure that Tesseract-OCR is added to your system PATH.
